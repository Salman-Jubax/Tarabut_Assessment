iOS development test regarding hiring

Dear Team,
Hope your doing well I have just cpmpletet your test according to requirements and have build iOS application (objective C). Although i can develop it on Swift as well but i did not see any langauge dependency on test requirement so I wrote objective C code. Secondly, I want to demonstrate one thing that i could find out the Web API for weather forecast that can show multiple weather updates at a time, so I just have an API can be able to show Dbai weather update for current hours in Fahrenheit and Celsius as well. Please screenshots in project.

Best regards
