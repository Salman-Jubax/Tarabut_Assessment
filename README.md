iOS development test regarding hiring

Dear Team,
Hope your doing well I have just cpmpleted your test according to requirements and have build iOS application (Objective-C). Although I can develop it on Swift as well but I did not see any langauge dependency on test requirement so I have written Objective-C code. Secondly, I want to demonstrate one thing that I could not be find out the Web API for weather forecast that can show multiple weather updates at a time, so I just have an API can be able to show Dubai weather update for current hours in Fahrenheit and Celsius as well. Please find screenshots in project.

Best regards .
